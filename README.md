# Learning wgpu
The main purpose of this repo is for me to refer back to, if need be,
and for others to be able to reference when following this <a href="https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/">short tutorial</a>.

By no means is this code meant to be performant. I have structured certain parts for the sake
of brevity and conciseness.
